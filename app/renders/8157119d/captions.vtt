1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Low desert ground. A sphere-tumbleweed rolls in—cinematic hook.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.500
We dolly along the dust, tracking the rolling sphere across the sand.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.500
Pull back: two cowboys made of cylinders face each other in silence.

4
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:15.500
A crosswind coils sand into rings; the tumbleweed drifts between them.

5
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:19.500
Push-in left: a cylindrical arm hovers by a cylindrical holster.

6
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:23.500
A tiny twitch—just a few degrees of rotation about the shoulder.

7
00:00:23.500 --> 00:00:27.500
Slide right: the other cowboy’s cylindrical hat tilts, reading the wind.

8
00:00:27.500 --> 00:00:31.500
The sphere crosses frame again, its rolling encoded by rotation about y.

9
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:36.000
Over-the-shoulder framing; the distance between them breathes.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Hands rise a hair—arms rotate up around the shoulder pivot.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Time stretches; dust rings spin; no one blinks.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Instead of drawing, both hats tip—a peaceful decision.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:53.000
We orbit slowly, revealing mirrored cylindrical silhouettes.

14
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:58.000
They step closer; the stage relaxes into warm color.

15
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The wind settles; tumbleweed exits; the town exhales.

16
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:06.000
Fade to sand and sky.
