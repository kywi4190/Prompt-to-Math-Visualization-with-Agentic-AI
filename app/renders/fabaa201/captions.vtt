00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Watch a square wave emerge from smooth sines.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Start with axes and the ideal square target in yellow.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
There's a jump at x = π — marked by a vertical guide.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.199
We'll build f_N(x), the partial Fourier sum using odd harmonics.

5
00:00:08.199 --> 00:00:09.599
N controls how many harmonics we include.

6
00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:12.000
With N = 3, the curve begins to resemble the square.

7
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.400
N = 5 sharpens edges and flattens plateaus.

8
00:00:14.400 --> 00:00:16.800
N = 7 tightens further, but overshoot near the jump persists.

9
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.199
N = 9: more detail, same Gibbs overshoot height.

10
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:20.899
Zoom in and notice ringing focuses near discontinuities.
