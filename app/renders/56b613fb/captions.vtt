00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Imagine a flat fabric representing R^n...

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We apply a warp using a symmetric positive definite matrix...

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
This warp changes distances and angles...

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, let's visualize the transformation T...

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
As we unwarp, we return to standard orthogonality...

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
The vectors align back to their original positions.
