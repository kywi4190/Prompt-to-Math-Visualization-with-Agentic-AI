1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
A dusty plain. Geometry stands in for grit.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Stacked cylinders rise: boots, legs, torso.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Across the way, another figure takes shape.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Two silhouettes face each other across the plane.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The camera settles in, air humming with heat.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
A sphere rolls in from the left—

7
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
—a tumbleweed: its spin set by distance over radius.

8
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Wind lines sweep the ground like sketched strokes.

9
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
The sphere wobbles past center, light and empty.

10
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:35.000
We drop to ground level: a slow, sand-hugging glide.

11
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:38.500
Cloth creaks; hinges prime at the shoulders.

12
00:00:38.500 --> 00:00:42.500
Arms pivot about fixed points, tilting toward danger.

13
00:00:42.500 --> 00:00:46.000
Silence expands between parallel silhouettes.

14
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:49.500
A slow orbit: circling the variables of resolve.

15
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:53.000
Nothing moves. That stillness is geometry too.

16
00:00:53.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We pull back: the plane dwarfs the players.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:58.500
Balance holds. No shot—just form and tension.

18
00:00:58.500 --> 00:01:01.600
Cut.
