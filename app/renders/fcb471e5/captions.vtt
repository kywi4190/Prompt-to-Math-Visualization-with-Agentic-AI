00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Imagine the plane...

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.500
Now warp the space...

3
00:00:04.500 --> 00:00:07.000
See how vectors stretch...

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.000
This is our inner product.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Next, visualize unwarping...

6
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:14.000
Here comes the map T...

7
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.500
Restoring orthogonality.

8
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.000
A new, clearer space.

9
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Where angles align.

10
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is geometry's dance.
