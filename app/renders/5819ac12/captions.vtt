00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
An inner product on R^n is a hidden warp of space — encoded by an SPD matrix A.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:06.500
The unit ball for ⟨x,y⟩_A = x^T A y is not a circle but an ellipse: directions are stretched and squeezed.

3
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:09.500
Two vectors can be A-orthogonal (x^T A y = 0) yet look non‑perpendicular in Euclidean view.

4
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:13.500
A simple unwarp: apply T = A^{1/2}. It carries the A-geometry to Euclidean geometry.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.500
The ellipse becomes a circle and the two vectors become Euclidean-orthogonal — orthogonality restored.

6
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.000
So every inner product is just a warped Euclidean picture; A^{1/2} straightens it.
