1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Low desert horizon. A standoff begins.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.200
Cylinders stack into cowboys: legs, torsos, hats.

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:07.000
The camera creeps sideways, revealing their silhouettes.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Close on the left: boots planted, hat brim steady.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Now the right: the same geometry, a mirror of resolve.

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:16.800
Silence.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:24.000
A sphere tumbles through—our tumbleweed—rolling and spinning.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Wind lines sweep by; dust and tension hang in the air.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.500
We rise into a wide, balanced shot of the duel.

10
00:00:30.500 --> 00:00:32.000
Cut to black.
