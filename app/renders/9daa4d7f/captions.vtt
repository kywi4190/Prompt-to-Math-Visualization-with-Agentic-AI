00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
A 3D vector split into orthogonal pieces.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Each colored arrow is one component along x, y, and z.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Together they add to the yellow vector.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:09.000
Now flatten to 2D to study a function.

5
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Target: f(x)=x on the interval [-π, π].

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
We approximate it by a Fourier sine series.

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Increase N: the partial sum S_N(x) gains more wiggles.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.500
Bars show the coefficients b_n = 2(-1)^{n+1}/n.

9
00:00:19.500 --> 00:00:22.500
As N grows, more bars appear and S_N(x) tracks f(x).

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.600
Fourier uses waves; Taylor would use powers.
