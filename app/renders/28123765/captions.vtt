00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Imagine a flat fabric representing R^n...

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
We apply a warp defined by a symmetric positive definite matrix...

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Vectors stretch and shear, changing their relationships...

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Now, let's visualize the transformation back to orthogonality...

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:15.000
We apply the inverse warp, uniting the vectors...

6
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Observe how they align back to standard orthogonality...

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:25.000
This is the essence of inner products in R^n!
