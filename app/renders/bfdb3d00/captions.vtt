1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A wide, dusty plain. Two cylinder cowboys face each other across the street.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
The camera glides to a three-quarter view, revealing distance and tension.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
A whisper of wind skims the ground—thin lines of dust cut across the frame.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Enter the tumbleweed: a lone sphere rolling in from the left.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Its spin matches the slide, like a wheel on sand, crossing the gap between rivals.

6
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Push-in to the left cowboy. His arm dips toward the holster—deliberate, controlled.

7
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Silence. Dust hangs. The brim casts a sharp shadow across a cylindrical brow.

8
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:32.000
Cut to the right cowboy. A subtle hat tilt; a boot taps the earth.

9
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
The camera breathes out—back to the wide frame, street stretching like a ruler.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Another gust lines the ground with streaks. The sun bakes the scene to stillness.

11
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
The tumbleweed exits frame, its path a clean arc across the foreground.

12
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
We drift into a slow orbit, measuring the standoff from new angles.

13
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Cylinders stack into silhouettes: brim, crown, head, torso, holster, boots.

14
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
The street is a flat plane; the duel, a line. Nothing moves—but everything could.

15
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Hold on the pose. The quiet hums. Cut when you feel the dust stop falling.
