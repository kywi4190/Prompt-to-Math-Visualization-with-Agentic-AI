00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Watch how a linear map bends the unit circle into an ellipse.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.500
This is a symmetric matrix A acting on the whole plane.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.200
Reset the scene to hunt for special directions.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.199
Eigen-lines: directions that A maps back onto themselves.

5
00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:12.800
Along each eigen-line, vectors only stretch—not turn.

6
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:15.300
We mark them with arrows and the scale factors λ1, λ2.

7
00:00:15.300 --> 00:00:17.800
Pick a generic vector v that is not on an eigen-line.

8
00:00:17.800 --> 00:00:22.000
Now apply A to everything at once.

9
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.500
Eigen-arrows stay on their lines and only change length.

10
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.000
But v turns and stretches: A mixes directions.

11
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:31.000
In short: Av = λv only for eigen-directions.
