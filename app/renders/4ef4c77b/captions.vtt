00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
Think of 3 × 4 as three hops of size four on a number line.

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.000
Hop, hop, hop — we land at twelve.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.799
Stack those groups: three rows of four make a rectangle.

4
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.199
Area of the 3-by-4 rectangle is twelve squares.

5
00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:11.000
Another view: multiplication scales lengths.

6
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:12.599
Stretch a length of four by three to get twelve.

7
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:13.500
Groups, area, scaling — same idea.
