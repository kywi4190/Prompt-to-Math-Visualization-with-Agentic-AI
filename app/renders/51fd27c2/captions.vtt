00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
On the real line, x^2 + 1 = 0 has no solution.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
So we extend: a second axis for multiples of i = sqrt(-1).

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now the points i and -i solve z^2 + 1 = 0.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Think of complex numbers as points in a plane: Re and Im.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Each point is a vector z with length r and angle θ.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
Polar form: z = r(cos θ + i sin θ) = r e^{iθ}.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Multiplying by i rotates any vector by 90°.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:28.000
Do it twice: i^2 sends 1 to -1.

9
00:00:28.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Multiplying by a + bi is a rotate + scale.

10
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:38.000
It's a linear map: [a -b; b a] acting on the plane.

11
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:42.000
Angles are preserved — the map is conformal.

12
00:00:42.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Example: z ↦ z^2 doubles angles on the unit circle.

13
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Two different z map to the same z^2 (two-to-one).

14
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Lift to 3D: height shows |z|, forming a cone.

15
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Our z projects up to height |z|; θ stays in the base.

16
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Complex numbers unify rotation and scaling across math.
