1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Start with a square face.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.599
Push a copy back and connect the corners—this makes a cube.

3
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:06.599
Each face is a square and every edge has the same length.

4
00:00:06.599 --> 00:00:09.599
Three independent directions: length, width, height.

5
00:00:09.599 --> 00:00:10.599
That's a cube.
