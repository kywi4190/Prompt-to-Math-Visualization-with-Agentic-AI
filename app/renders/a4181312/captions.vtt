1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.799
Slice a donut with a moving plane—watch the loops appear and disappear.

2
00:00:03.799 --> 00:00:07.799
We track level sets: intersection of the torus with a horizontal plane.

3
00:00:07.799 --> 00:00:09.800
First touch at the bottom: a single loop is born.

4
00:00:09.800 --> 00:00:18.199
Between critical heights, the slice is two disjoint loops circling the torus.

5
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:20.600
At the middle height, the slice straddles the hole: a saddle level.

6
00:00:20.600 --> 00:00:28.600
Climbing toward the top, the two loops draw together.

7
00:00:28.600 --> 00:00:30.600
At the top critical height they merge into one loop.

8
00:00:30.600 --> 00:00:35.000
Above it, the level set vanishes: no loops remain.

9
00:00:35.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Component count by height: 0 → 1 → 2 → 1 → 0.

10
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
Changes happen only at critical heights of the height function on the torus.

11
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:54.000
This Morse–Bott picture encodes topology: handles appear as loops split and merge.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Morse theory: topology from the movie of slices.
