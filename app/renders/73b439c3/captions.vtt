00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.800
Let’s build a sawtooth f(x)=x from sine waves.

2
00:00:01.800 --> 00:00:03.000
Left: the function plot. Right: a panel of coefficients.

3
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.200
First, visualize a few sine building blocks.

4
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:05.400
Our target on (-π, π) is the yellow line: f(x)=x.

5
00:00:05.400 --> 00:00:07.000
Bars will show Fourier sine coefficients 2(-1)^{n+1}/n.

6
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:16.500
Watch S_N(x) grow and oscillations settle as N increases.

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.000
Near x=π, a persistent overshoot appears: Gibbs phenomenon.

8
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.199
It never disappears—only narrows as N → ∞.
