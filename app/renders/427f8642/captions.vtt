00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Think of 3 × 4 as three groups of four.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Lay the groups end-to-end: 4 + 4 + 4 becomes 12.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Now rearrange the same pieces into a 3 by 4 array.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Rows and columns make the structure visible.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Multiplication is area: width 4 and height 3.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.000
So 3 × 4 equals 12.
