1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:00.800
A simple plane as our fabric of reality.

2
00:00:00.800 --> 00:00:02.000
Symmetry reveals invariants: area under det=1 maps.

3
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Rotate: orientation changes, area stays the same.

4
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Shear: new shape, same area — still det = 1.

5
00:00:06.500 --> 00:00:07.299
Now zoom out to galaxies.

6
00:00:07.299 --> 00:00:10.300
Expansion: a(t) scales distances from a common center.

7
00:00:10.900 --> 00:00:11.699
Microscopic states start clustered.

8
00:00:11.699 --> 00:00:14.699
Area-preserving shear stretches and folds the cloud.

9
00:00:14.699 --> 00:00:17.699
Alternating shears mix further — entropy rises.

10
00:00:17.699 --> 00:00:19.699
Meaning: invariants + dynamics → emergent patterns.
