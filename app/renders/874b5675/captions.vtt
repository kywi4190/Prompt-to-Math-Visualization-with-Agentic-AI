00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
A complex number is a point—an arrow—on a plane.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Multiplying by i rotates 90 degrees. Rotation is built into multiplication.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.000
Functions reshape the plane. Let's try squaring: w = z^2.

4
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.500
Rays: angles double. Circles: radii square. The unit circle stays a circle.

5
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.500
Now lift into 3D: height = 1/(1 + |z^2 - 1|).

6
00:00:15.500 --> 00:00:18.500
Peaks mark the zeros of z^2 - 1 at z = ±1.

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.500
Geometry reveals algebra: solving becomes searching for peaks.

8
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:24.000
This is the power of complex numbers: rotations, waves, and roots become visual.
