1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
A triangle, with two moves: rotate r and reflect s.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.000
r twists by 120 degrees. Three r's return to start.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:05.500
s flips across the vertical mirror line.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Shift left; we’ll build the Cayley graph on the right.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:08.500
Six group elements become six nodes.

6
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Blue edges are r; orange edges are s.

7
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:11.199
We trace a word: w = r r s r r s.

8
00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:12.599
Start at the identity, e.

9
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.000
Apply r.

10
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:15.400
Apply r again.

11
00:00:15.400 --> 00:00:16.800
Flip with s.

12
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:18.199
Rotate by r.

13
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:19.600
Rotate by r again.

14
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:21.000
Flip with s — we’re back at e!

15
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:22.500
So w equals the identity: the triangle returns.
