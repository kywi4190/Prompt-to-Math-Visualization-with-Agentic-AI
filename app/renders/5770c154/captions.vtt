1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Two sheets for one function: the square-root surface.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:07.500
We build the Riemann surface of w^2 = z.

3
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:11.000
The floor is the complex z-plane.

4
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:15.000
Above each z, two w-values form two layers.

5
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:19.000
They glue along a branch cut on the negative real axis.

6
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Think of two sheets sewn together along that line.

7
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Trace a loop around zero down on the plane.

8
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Lift it: the point rises and twists with angle halved.

9
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
After one full turn, the lift ends on the other sheet.

10
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:41.000
This is monodromy: going once swaps branches.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:47.000
Go around a second time to return to the start.

12
00:00:47.000 --> 00:00:52.000
The origin is a branch point; the cut makes a single chart.

13
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
On the surface, sqrt is single-valued and smooth.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:00:59.200
One function, two sheets, one seam—now glued into a whole.
