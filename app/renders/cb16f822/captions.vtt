1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.200
Addition on a line: steps stack end-to-end.

2
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:06.000
Two steps, 2 then 3, land us at 5.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:07.200
Now upgrade to the plane: vectors.

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.500
Draw vectors a and b from the origin.

5
00:00:10.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Slide b to the head of a — the head-to-tail rule.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:18.500
The yellow dot traces: do a, then do b.

7
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:20.500
Commutativity: swap roles, same endpoint.

8
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.199
Add a third vector c; still tip-to-tail.

9
00:00:22.199 --> 00:00:23.800
The long arrow is a + b + c.
