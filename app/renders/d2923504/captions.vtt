1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Division asks: how many times does a chunk fit?

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:06.799
Here, 12 divided by 3 is: how many 3-long steps fit into 12?

3
00:00:06.799 --> 00:00:08.500
Step, step, step, step — four times.

4
00:00:08.500 --> 00:00:10.199
So 12 / 3 = 4.

5
00:00:10.199 --> 00:00:13.500
Another view: split 12 into 3 equal parts.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.800
Each piece has length 4 — the same answer.
