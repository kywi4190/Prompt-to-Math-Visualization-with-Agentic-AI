1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Achilles and a tortoise start on a track. Achilles is faster.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:03.500
The tortoise has a head start.

3
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:05.500
Speeds: Achilles 2 units/s, tortoise 1 unit/s.

4
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.500
Zeno's idea: Achilles first reaches the tortoise's previous spot.

5
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
By then, the tortoise has moved ahead a bit.

6
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Repeat: each chase step is half as long as the last.

7
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
These intervals form a geometric sequence with ratio 1/2.

8
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.500
Visually, colored segments shrink and accumulate.

9
00:00:21.500 --> 00:00:23.899
Half plus quarter plus eighth... sums to a finite time.

10
00:00:23.899 --> 00:00:26.899
Slide left to compare motion with a time–position graph.

11
00:00:26.899 --> 00:00:29.000
Each runner's position is a straight line in time.

12
00:00:29.000 --> 00:00:33.000
Advance a shared time cursor; watch both positions together.

13
00:00:33.000 --> 00:00:37.000
The lines intersect at the meeting event.

14
00:00:37.000 --> 00:00:45.399
Time flows steadily; both dots approach the crossing point.

15
00:00:45.399 --> 00:00:47.500
There it is: they meet at the same time and place.

16
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.899
Snap the track view to the meeting point.

17
00:00:49.899 --> 00:00:53.500
Infinite steps can sum to a finite time—paradox resolved.
