00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A desert breathes. Wide shot. Heat shimmers. Two silhouettes face each other across the sand.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
We push toward the left cowboy. Cylinders stack into a hat, a head, a body. Wind teases the brim.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A lone tumbleweed rolls across the frame. The ground hums with thin ribbons of wind.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:23.000
Pan to the rival on the right. The arm lowers, then steadies—aim lines up along the horizon.

5
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Two-shot. The gap between them is geometry: one line of sight, two verticals, a plane of dust.

6
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Hands hover near the iron. Arms rotate from a low angle to level—hinges about a shoulder pivot.

7
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Silence stretches. The camera arcs around them, measuring the distance with a slow orbit.

8
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:52.000
A crane up reveals the whole scene: two cylinders of resolve anchored to the desert plane.

9
00:00:52.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Title drifts in: HIGH NOON. The standoff freezes in time, a clean diagram of tension.
