00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Think of the plane as a rubber grid; arrows are the unit directions.

2
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:16.000
A matrix A warps everything together: it pushes, stretches, and shears.

3
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Area scales by det(A). The unit square becomes a parallelogram of area det(A).

4
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Any warp can be assembled from simpler moves—watch: shear, then stretch.

5
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Some directions don't turn at all: eigenvectors. They only scale.

6
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Solving Ax = b means: find x whose image under A lands right on b.

7
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Linear algebra is the geometry of change.
