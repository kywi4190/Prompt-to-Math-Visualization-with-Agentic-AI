1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:01.199
A grid and unit circle: the complex plane.

2
00:00:01.199 --> 00:00:03.200
Multiplying by i means a 90° rotation.

3
00:00:03.200 --> 00:00:05.200
Watch the triangle turn by i.

4
00:00:05.200 --> 00:00:07.000
Start at 1; rotate once by i.

5
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.199
Rotate again: i·i = i^2.

6
00:00:09.199 --> 00:00:10.599
That lands at −1.

7
00:00:10.599 --> 00:00:12.599
Now two numbers: z (blue) and w (green).

8
00:00:12.599 --> 00:00:14.199
Their product is the yellow arrow.

9
00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:16.800
Rule: add angles when multiplying.

10
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.199
See the angle sum steer zw.

11
00:00:19.199 --> 00:00:21.600
Rule: multiply magnitudes.

12
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:24.600
|zw| = |z| |w|.

13
00:00:24.600 --> 00:00:26.600
Let’s view magnitude as height.

14
00:00:26.600 --> 00:00:29.199
Fly the camera into 3D.

15
00:00:29.199 --> 00:00:31.000
A cone: height grows with radius.

16
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.600
Lift the product tip straight up.

17
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.000
Its height matches |zw|.

18
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:38.000
Change |w|; the height changes.

19
00:00:38.000 --> 00:00:40.399
Parallax reveals the shape.

20
00:00:40.399 --> 00:00:42.600
Summary: multiply magnitudes, add angles.

21
00:00:42.600 --> 00:00:45.000
Thanks for watching!
