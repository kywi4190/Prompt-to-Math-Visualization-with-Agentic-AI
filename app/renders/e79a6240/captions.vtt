1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.200
On a number line, 3 groups of 2 step forward and land at 6.

2
00:00:04.200 --> 00:00:09.000
Multiplying by 3 also means scaling: every distance stretches threefold.

3
00:00:09.000 --> 00:00:12.000
In two dimensions, a x b is area: how many unit squares fit.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:14.199
Here 3 by 2 covers 6 unit squares.

5
00:00:14.199 --> 00:00:15.599
Turn it on its side: 2 by 3 — same area.
