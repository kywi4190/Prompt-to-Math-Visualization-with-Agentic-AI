1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.500
Watch a tilted torus get sliced by a moving plane.

2
00:00:03.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Each slice is a level set of height: z = h.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Morse theory: topology changes only at critical heights.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500
We tilt the torus so the height function has 4 isolated critical points.

5
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:17.000
Min, two saddles, and a max—marked on the surface.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Start below: no intersection with the plane.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Rising past the minimum, one small loop appears.

8
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:31.000
Between min and first saddle: the loop grows.

9
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:36.000
At a saddle height, two loops merge through a pinch.

10
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:41.000
Between the saddles: the slice becomes two disjoint loops.

11
00:00:41.000 --> 00:00:46.000
At the second saddle, they pinch again—back to one loop.

12
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Approaching the maximum, the loop shrinks and vanishes.

13
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:56.000
Morse intuition: topology jumps only at critical heights.

14
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Each saddle corresponds to a handle being attached.

15
00:01:00.000 --> 00:01:04.000
A torus is built by one minimum, two saddles, and one maximum.
