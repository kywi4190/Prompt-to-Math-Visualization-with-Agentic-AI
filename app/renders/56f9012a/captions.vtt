1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.799
Think of a person as a point in a three-skill space.

2
00:00:02.799 --> 00:00:05.599
Axes measure Chef, Rap, and TV tendencies.

3
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.400
From the origin, the vector grows to that person.

4
00:00:08.400 --> 00:00:11.199
Project to the floor and walls to see each component.

5
00:00:11.199 --> 00:00:14.000
Orange, blue, and green segments add tip-to-tail.

6
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:16.800
Dashed drops show shadows on the coordinate planes.

7
00:00:16.800 --> 00:00:19.600
Tags near the tip remind what this direction hints at.

8
00:00:19.600 --> 00:00:22.399
The numbers form a tuple v = (a, b, c).

9
00:00:22.399 --> 00:00:25.199
Rotate to feel depth and how components align.

10
00:00:25.199 --> 00:00:27.000
It’s all direction and length—the geometry of a persona.
