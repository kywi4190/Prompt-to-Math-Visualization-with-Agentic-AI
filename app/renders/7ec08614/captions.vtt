00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.200
Think of multiplication as making equal groups.

2
00:00:02.200 --> 00:00:05.000
Start with 4 dots in a row.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.500
Make 3 rows: 4 + 4 + 4.

4
00:00:07.500 --> 00:00:10.000
Those groups form a 3 by 4 rectangle—the area is the product.

5
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.500
Same idea: 3 × 4 scales 4 by a factor of 3.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.500
The arrow stretches from 4 to 12.

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:19.500
Groups, area, and scaling are the same story.
