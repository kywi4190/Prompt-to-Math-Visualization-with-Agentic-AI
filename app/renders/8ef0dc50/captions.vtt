00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Imagine a pizza divided into slices...

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.000
Each slice represents a part of the whole.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:08.000
If we have 8 slices and 4 friends...

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
We can share them equally.

5
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Each friend gets 2 slices.

6
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:20.000
This is how division works!
