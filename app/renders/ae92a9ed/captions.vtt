00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
Twelve things split into three equal groups.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:05.000
Watch each group light up: four in each.

3
00:00:05.000 --> 00:00:07.000
That's the meaning of 12 ÷ 3 = 4.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:09.500
Now slide along a number line from 0 to 12.

5
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:12.500
Each jump of 3 marks one group.

6
00:00:12.500 --> 00:00:15.000
Four jumps reach 12: four groups.

7
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.500
Let's see the same idea as scaling.

8
00:00:17.500 --> 00:00:20.500
On axes, x triples while y grows to twelve.

9
00:00:20.500 --> 00:00:22.500
The line y = 4x shows 'times four'.

10
00:00:22.500 --> 00:00:24.500
Transform 12 ÷ 3 = 4 into 3x = 12.

11
00:00:24.500 --> 00:00:26.500
Solve for x: x = 4.
