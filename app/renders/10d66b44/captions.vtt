1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Division asks two things: share evenly, or measure how many fit.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:05.500
Sharing view: split 12 things into 3 equal groups.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:07.000
Each group ends up with 4.

4
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:11.500
Measurement view: how many 3s fit into 12?

5
00:00:11.500 --> 00:00:13.500
Four steps of size 3 land exactly on 12.

6
00:00:13.500 --> 00:00:16.000
Scaling view: dividing by 3 shrinks lengths to one third.

7
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:18.500
Same idea, same answer: 12 ÷ 3 = 4.
