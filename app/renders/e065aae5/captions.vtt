1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
Complex numbers live on a plane; multiplication rotates and scales.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:05.599
Plot a point z = a + bi and draw its vector from the origin.

3
00:00:05.599 --> 00:00:08.000
The angle from the x-axis is the argument of z.

4
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:11.000
Multiplying by i is a 90° counterclockwise rotation.

5
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:14.599
Rotate back to the original z; remember that angle.

6
00:00:14.599 --> 00:00:18.199
Now compare z to its square z^2, shown in orange.

7
00:00:18.199 --> 00:00:22.000
As z makes one full turn, z^2 spins twice and changes length.

8
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:25.399
Multiplying by a + bi is a linear map of the entire plane.

9
00:00:25.399 --> 00:00:28.500
The grid rotates and scales together with z.

10
00:00:28.500 --> 00:00:31.000
Undo the map: multiplication is rotate + scale.

11
00:00:31.000 --> 00:00:33.600
Lift to 3D: make height equal to |z^2 + 1|.

12
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:36.399
This surface turns modulus into altitude.

13
00:00:36.399 --> 00:00:40.000
Mark the roots: z = i and z = -i give height zero.

14
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Orbit the camera to feel the shape of the landscape.

15
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Two symmetric pits show where z^2 + 1 vanishes.

16
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:51.000
Everywhere else the surface stays above zero: a modulus can't be negative.

17
00:00:51.000 --> 00:00:54.000
Wrap up: multiplication rotates and scales; roots sit at height 0.

18
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:55.000
Keep this geometric picture in mind when you compute with complex numbers.
