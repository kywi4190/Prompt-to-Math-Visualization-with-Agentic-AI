00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
Low angle. Dusty boots: cylinders rising from the sand. A quiet breath before the draw.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Tilt up the first cowboy: stacked cylinders—legs, torso, head—and a thin-brim hat.

3
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Cut to the rival. Same geometry, different stance. Symmetry builds tension.

4
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Wide shot. The empty street is a flat plane; the horizon is a vertical sheet of sky.

5
00:00:22.000 --> 00:00:26.000
Wind picks up. Streamlines drift across the ground, hinting at direction.

6
00:00:26.000 --> 00:00:32.000
A sphere—the tumbleweed—rolls in from the left, hugging the sand plane.

7
00:00:32.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Rolling without slipping: angle increases by distance divided by radius.

8
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
Camera tracks alongside the sphere; the cowboys hold steady.

9
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:46.000
It threads the gap. Shadows stretch; silence thickens.

10
00:00:46.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Hands twitch—a tiny rotation of arm-cylinders. No words.

11
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:54.000
The wind softens; the tumbleweed drifts off frame.

12
00:00:54.000 --> 00:00:58.000
Dust glitters and settles. Time stretches.

13
00:00:58.000 --> 00:01:02.000
Pull back. The whole tableau—two figures, a street, a memory.

14
00:01:02.000 --> 00:01:04.000
Fade to quiet. The duel is in the stillness.
