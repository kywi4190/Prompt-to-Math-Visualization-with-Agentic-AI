1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:04.000
A wide desert plane. Two geometric cowboys stare each other down.

2
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Camera drifts in; a hard noon sun burns above.

3
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Left: a hat brim, a steady shoulder, a hand near the holster.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:16.000
Right mirrors the stance; everything is symmetry and distance.

5
00:00:16.000 --> 00:00:21.000
From overhead, straight sight-lines sketch the duel.

6
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:25.000
The gap between them is the stage, a single measured line.

7
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Back to the wide shot. Stillness returns.

8
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
A tumbleweed rolls through, a circle tracing time.

9
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:39.000
Wind lines slide across the ground; the moment stretches.

10
00:00:39.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Draw. Each gun snaps to a perfect line toward the other.

11
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:50.000
Tiny flashes: geometry of aim, no words needed.

12
00:00:50.000 --> 00:00:56.000
We pull back; two figures frozen in balance.

13
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:02.000
The geometry of a standoff.
