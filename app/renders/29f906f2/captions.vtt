00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Imagine hiking on a bowl-shaped hill: a paraboloid.

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:04.000
The gradient shows the direction of steepest uphill.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:06.000
We set up axes, the surface z = x^2 + y^2, and a ground grid.

4
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:08.000
Pick a radius r and angle t on the ground to choose a point.

5
00:00:08.000 --> 00:00:09.500
Lift that point up to the surface along a vertical line.

6
00:00:09.500 --> 00:00:11.000
Draw the contour circle r = const on the ground.

7
00:00:11.000 --> 00:00:13.000
The red arrow is the gradient on the plane; it points radially.

8
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:15.000
The cyan arrow is tangent to the contour; it points along the circle.

9
00:00:15.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Notice the right angle: gradient is perpendicular to contours.

10
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:19.000
Let the point orbit once: watch the directions as t increases.

11
00:00:19.000 --> 00:00:21.000
The gradient always aligns with the radius of the contour.

12
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:23.000
And the tangent arrow stays orthogonal to it everywhere.

13
00:00:23.000 --> 00:00:25.000
Increase the radius r: we move farther from the peak.

14
00:00:25.000 --> 00:00:27.000
The slope gets steeper outward: |∇f| grows with r.

15
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:29.500
Another lap: orthogonality still holds along the whole circle.

16
00:00:29.500 --> 00:00:31.500
Reframe the camera to see the climb direction clearly.

17
00:00:31.500 --> 00:00:33.500
Green arrow: the steepest ascent on the surface itself.

18
00:00:33.500 --> 00:00:35.500
It tilts upward and projects to the red gradient on the plane.

19
00:00:35.500 --> 00:00:37.500
Bring the radius inward slightly: the slope decreases.

20
00:00:37.500 --> 00:00:39.500
Yet the ascent direction still aligns with the gradient.

21
00:00:39.500 --> 00:00:41.500
One more orbit: gradient stays radial, tangent stays circular.

22
00:00:41.500 --> 00:00:43.500
Contours are level sets: all points of equal height.

23
00:00:43.500 --> 00:00:45.500
The gradient points in the direction of fastest increase.

24
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:47.500
And it is perpendicular to every level set it meets.

25
00:00:47.500 --> 00:00:49.500
Summary: Gradient = fastest increase; Contours = constant height.

26
00:00:49.500 --> 00:00:51.500
On this paraboloid, ∇f points straight outward on the ground.

27
00:00:51.500 --> 00:00:53.399
That outward direction lifts you uphill the quickest.
