1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.000
Division asks: how many copies of b fit into a?

2
00:00:02.000 --> 00:00:07.000
Here, 12 divided by 3: four steps of size 3 fill the length 12.

3
00:00:07.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Equal sharing view: 12 dots grouped by 3 make 4 baskets.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Make the groups smaller—divide by 2—and you get 6 baskets.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:17.000
If it doesn't fit exactly, like 7 ÷ 3, two steps fit and 1 is left over.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:20.000
That leftover is the remainder.

7
00:00:20.000 --> 00:00:22.000
Division finds the missing factor: 3 × ? = 12 becomes 3 × 4 = 12.
