00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
A complex number is both a point and a vector in the plane.

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:06.000
Watch e^{it} sweep the unit circle as t increases.

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:10.000
Its projections are cos t on the x-axis and sin t on the y-axis.

4
00:00:10.000 --> 00:00:14.000
The phasor keeps rotating smoothly around the circle.

5
00:00:14.000 --> 00:00:17.000
Multiplying by i is a 90° rotation about the origin.

6
00:00:17.000 --> 00:00:21.000
Measure the angle between w and i·w to see the quarter-turn.

7
00:00:21.000 --> 00:00:24.000
Now a nonlinear map: f(z) = z^2.

8
00:00:24.000 --> 00:00:27.000
Pick a point p and draw two tiny rays from p.

9
00:00:27.000 --> 00:00:30.000
Their angle at p is highlighted.

10
00:00:30.000 --> 00:00:34.000
Map those rays through f; curves appear near q = f(p).

11
00:00:34.000 --> 00:00:36.000
Near q, tangents are given by the derivative f'(p).

12
00:00:36.000 --> 00:00:40.000
These tangents define the image angle at q.

13
00:00:40.000 --> 00:00:44.000
Now rotate the second ray at p while tracking both angles.

14
00:00:44.000 --> 00:00:48.000
Watch the image angle follow exactly—no distortion of angle.

15
00:00:48.000 --> 00:00:52.000
Angles match: that's conformality at p.

16
00:00:52.000 --> 00:00:56.000
For z^2, f'(p)=2p scales and rotates locally.

17
00:00:56.000 --> 00:01:00.000
Complex maps bend shapes but preserve tiny angles.
