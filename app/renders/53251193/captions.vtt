1
00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.600
The area of this parallelogram equals the magnitude of det[u, v].

2
00:00:02.600 --> 00:00:05.500
Vectors u and v span the shape; watch the fill encode the sign.

3
00:00:05.500 --> 00:00:08.800
Top-right: det = (sign) (value). Blue for positive, red for negative.

4
00:00:08.800 --> 00:00:12.800
As v slides to align with u, the area collapses to zero.

5
00:00:12.800 --> 00:00:17.199
Near zero, the color softens to avoid a harsh flip.

6
00:00:17.199 --> 00:00:21.600
Crossing through alignment flips orientation—and the sign of det.

7
00:00:21.600 --> 00:00:25.500
Different shapes, same rule: area equals |det|, sign encodes orientation.

8
00:00:25.500 --> 00:00:28.500
Det tracks how u twists v: counterclockwise positive, clockwise negative.
