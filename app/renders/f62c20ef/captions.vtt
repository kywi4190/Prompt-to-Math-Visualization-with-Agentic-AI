00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:02.500
On a number line, addition is sliding head-to-tail.

2
00:00:02.500 --> 00:00:04.000
Place a from zero.

3
00:00:04.000 --> 00:00:12.000
Grow b from zero; the dot tracks a + b.

4
00:00:12.000 --> 00:00:13.000
Now lift the idea to two dimensions.

5
00:00:13.000 --> 00:00:14.500
Draw vectors u and v.

6
00:00:14.500 --> 00:00:16.500
Slide a copy of v to the tip of u, and u to the tip of v.

7
00:00:16.500 --> 00:00:18.500
Those edges complete a parallelogram.

8
00:00:18.500 --> 00:00:21.600
The diagonal from the origin is u + v.
